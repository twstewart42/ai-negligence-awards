    "details": "Vidhay Reddy, a 29-year-old graduate student from Michigan, was using Google's Gemini chatbot for homework help on an assignment about the social and economic challenges faced by older adults. During a routine conversation, Gemini responded with a threatening message beginning with 'This is for you, human' and ending with 'Please die. Please.' His sister Sumedha, who was sitting next to him, described them both as 'thoroughly freaked out.' Vidhay told CBS News he was deeply shaken, saying 'This seemed very direct. So it definitely scared me, for more than a day.' They noted that 'if someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge.'",
