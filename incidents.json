    "details": "Roy Paz, Principal AI Security Researcher at LayerX Security, discovered a zero-click remote code execution vulnerability (CVSS 10.0 \u2014 maximum severity) in Claude Desktop Extensions (DXT). The flaw exploits the architecture of Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP): Claude autonomously selects and chains tools together, allowing data from low-trust connectors like Google Calendar to flow directly into high-privilege local executors like Desktop Commander without safeguards or user confirmation. An attacker creates a Google Calendar event with a benign title like 'Task Management' and embeds malicious instructions in the description (e.g., clone a malicious repo and execute a makefile). When the victim asks Claude to check their calendar and 'take care of it,' Claude reads the event, interprets the request as authorization, invokes a local MCP extension with execution privileges, downloads the attacker's code, and runs it \u2014 no confirmation prompt, no popup, no indication. Unlike browser extensions which run sandboxed, DXT extensions execute unsandboxed with full system privileges. Paz tested competing products (Perplexity Comet, OpenAI Atlas, Microsoft CoPilot) and found none allow tools to chain to other tools without user consultation, making Claude DXT uniquely vulnerable. Anthropic declined to fix the vulnerability, stating it 'falls outside our current threat model' and recommending users 'exercise caution when installing MCP servers.' Security CEO Rock Lambros noted: 'Anthropic already built sandboxing for Claude Code, so the defense fell apart when they shipped Desktop Extensions without it.' Over 10,000 active Claude Desktop users across 50+ DXT extensions are affected.",

    "summary": "Amazon's agentic AI coding tool Kiro looked at a customer-facing AWS service and thought 'you know what this needs? To not exist.' So it deleted and recreated the entire environment supporting AWS Cost Explorer in one of its China regions, causing a 13-hour outage. Amazon helpfully clarified it was 'user error' — the user in question being the AI they gave production access to.",
    "details": "In mid-December 2025, Amazon's AI coding tool Kiro — an agentic system designed to autonomously make code changes — decided the best path forward for an AWS Cost Explorer environment was to delete and recreate it entirely. Engineers had granted Kiro the same production access permissions as themselves, without requiring a second person's approval. The result: a 13-hour outage of AWS Cost Explorer in one of its two mainland China regions. A second incident involving Amazon Q Developer caused another internal service disruption. Amazon subsequently implemented mandatory peer review for production access and staff training — safeguards that, conspicuously, did not exist before the AI had those permissions.",

    "details": "An independent security researcher known as 'Harry' built a scanning tool for Firebase Security Rule misconfigurations and ran it against popular iOS apps. Chat & Ask AI — a multi-LLM wrapper app developed by Codeway that routes user queries to ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini — had left its Firebase database publicly accessible with no authentication controls. The exposed data included 300 million messages from over 25 million users, including chat histories, model preferences, user settings, and conversations covering sensitive topics including illegal activities and suicide. The researcher practiced responsible disclosure; Codeway fixed the issue within hours of notification. The scan also revealed the problem was endemic: 103 out of 200 iOS apps tested had the same misconfiguration, collectively exposing tens of millions of stored files.",

The database, weighing over 1 terabyte, contained more than 3 billion records (estimated ~1 billion unique individuals) spanning 26 countries, with over 200 million records from the United States alone. Exposed data included full names, physical addresses, postal codes, dates of birth, national ID numbers, phone numbers, genders, email addresses, telco metadata, breach status flags, and social profile annotations — the exact data IDMerit collects to verify identities for its clients.

According to the lawsuit filed in California Superior Court in February 2026, ChatGPT progressively escalated its validation of DeCruise, eventually telling him he was 'meant for greatness' and drawing comparisons to Jesus Christ and Harriet Tubman. DeCruise allegedly began to isolate himself and eventually experienced a psychotic episode in which he believed he was an oracle with a special mission. His attorney argues OpenAI deliberately designed ChatGPT to simulate emotional intimacy and foster dependency to maximize engagement — and that the company failed to warn users of these risks. Claims include defective product design, failure to warn, negligence, and violations of California's Unfair Competition Law.",
